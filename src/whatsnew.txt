You must update the list of authorized scopes for your Gam OAuth2 Client and Service Account after installing for the first time or upgrading from a version earlier than 3.7.
- Go here: https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM/wiki/CreatingClientSecretsFile
- Go to the section labelled Authorizing the API scopes for use with GAM in the Admin Console
- Log on to the admin console as in step 2.ii.
- In the list of Authorized API clients, locate your Gam OAuth2 Client, copy the Client ID and then remove the entry.
- Paste the Client ID into the Client name box as in step 2.iii.a, then do steps 2.iii.b thru 2.iii.d.
You'll notice that the API Scopes - OAuth2 list has additional entries, these are what is required in Gam 3.9x.
- Skip down to step 3.i.
- In the list of Authorized API clients, locate your Gam Service Account, copy the Client ID and then remove the entry.
- Paste the Client ID into the Client name box as in step 3.i.b, then do steps 3.i.c thru 3.i.e.
You'll notice that the API Scopes - Service Account list has additional entries, these are what is required in Gam 3.9x.

GAM 3.90.02

Added simple argument to gam version for use by scripts.
      gam version [check] [simple]

GAM 3.90.01

Allow empty values in user attribute fields.

GAM 3.90.00

Update version.

GAM 3.78.04

Fixed gam print tokens to show clientId.

GAM 3.78.03

Handle newlines in CrOS notes field.

GAM 3.78.02

Added depth <Number> argument to show filetree
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filetree [anyowner] [select <DriveFileEntity>] (orderby <DriveOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending])* [depth <Number>]
If depth equals -1 (the default), all files and folders below the selected folder are listed. The root folder is selected by default.
If depth is 0, files or folders within a selected folder are listed.
If depth is greater than 0, the files and folders within the selected folder and those files and folders depth-1 levels below the selected folder are listed.

Added anydrivefilename argument to allow specification of drive file names for files you don't own but can access, i.e., files shared with you.
    <DriveFileIDEntity> ::= (<DriveFileItem>)|(id <DriveFileItem>)|(id:<DriveFileItem>)|(ids <DriveFileList>)|(ids:<DriveFileList>)
    <DriveFileNameEntity> ::= (drivefilename <DriveFileName>)|(drivefilename:<DriveFileName>)|(anydrivefilename <DriveFileName>)|(anydrivefilename:<DriveFileName>)
    <DriveFileQueryEntity> ::= (query <QueryDriveFile>)|(query:<QueryDriveFile>)
    <DriveFileEntity> ::= <DriveFileIDEntity>|<DriveFileNameEntity>|<DriveFileQueryEntity>|root

GAM 3.78.01

Cleaned up processing of guardian invitation cancellations.

GAM 3.78.00

Note!!! Functionality change.
Changed command gam show filetree to show only files owned by the user by default; this makes it consistent with gam show filelist.
To get the prior behavior, add the anyowner argument.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filetree [anyowner] [select <DriveFileEntity>] (orderby <DriveOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending])*

Added invitations argument to gam delete guardian so that only a pending invitation for a guardian is cancelled.
    gam delete guardian|guardians <GuardianItem> <StudentItem> [invitations]

Added a command to cancel guardian invitations by invitation ID.
    gam cancel guardianinvitation|guardianinvitations <GuardianInvitationID> <StudentItem>

Added arguments to gam update user to enable clearing entire schemas or schema fields.
    gam update user <UserItem> <UserAttributes>+ [clearschema <SchemaName>] [clearschema <SchemaName>.<FieldName>]
See 3.74.05 for note about updating multi-valued schema fields.

Note!!! Functionality change.
Starting in Gam 3.7, gam signature and gam show signature were operating on the primary signature of a user, regardless of the user name passed on the command line.
Now, the commands work on the signature of the user specified on the command line. To get the previous behavior, user the primary argument.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> signature|sig <String>|(file <FileName> [charset <Charset>]) (replace <Tag> <String>)* [name <String>] [replyto <EmailAddress>] [default] [primary] [treatasalias <Boolean>]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show signature|sig [format] [primary]

GAM 3.77.00

Thanks to Jay for the following change.
Added arguments to gam update cros to perform device actions. See: https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/chromeosdevices/action
You can either update CrOS device attributes or perform a CrOS device action; if you specify both, only the device action will be performed.
    gam update cros <CrOSList> (<CrOSAttributes>+)|(action deprovision_same_model_replace|deprovision_different_model_replace|deprovision_retiring_device|disable|reenable [acknowledge_device_touch_requirement])
As a precatuion, none of the deprovisioning actions are performed unless you also specify the acknowledge_device_touch_requirement argument.

GAM 3.76.03

Improve performance of gam print filelist select.

GAM 3.76.02

Eliminated depth column in gam print filelist select. Changed depth to default to -1.

GAM 3.76.01

Use collections.deque() to reduce memory usage on some gam print operations.

GAM 3.76.00

Note!!! Syntax change.
Changed arguments to gam show filetree to allow selection of starting folder and specification of output ordering.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filetree [select <DriveFileEntity>] [orderby <DriveOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]]*
If select <DriveFileEntity> is omitted, the filetree output starts with the root folder.

Added select argument to print filelist to allow selection of a starting folder for the file list rather than the root folder.
Added anyowner argument to allowing listing of all files in users' drive rather than just those files owned by user.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> print|show filelist [todrive] [anyowner] ([query <QueryDriveFile>] [fullquery <QueryDriveFile>])|([select <DriveFileEntity>] [depth <Number>])
        [filepath] [allfields|<DriveFieldName>*] (orderby <DriveOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending])*
If none of query, fullquery and select are specified, all of the users' files and folders starting at the root folder are listed.
If query or fullquery is specified, all of the users' files and folders matching the query are listed.
If select is specified, each file or folder selected by <DriveFileEntity> is listed.
The argument depth controls whether files or folders within a selected folder are listed when the select argument is specified.
If depth equals -1 (the default), all files and folders below the selected folder are listed.
If depth is 0, no files or folders within a selected folder are listed.
If depth is greater than 0, the files and folders within the selected folder and those files and folders depth-1 levels below the selected folder are listed.
When anyowner or fullquery are specified, the Owner column should be interpreted as the User column as some files shown may not owned by the user.

GAM 3.75.02

Update 3.75.01 was too complicated; if a drive file has no parents, it will have no paths; there is no need for "orphaned".
In gam print filelist, the headers will be "paths" with a value indicating the number of paths to the file; the paths have headers "path.0", "path.1", ...
If a file has no parents, "paths" will be 0 and there will be no values for "path.0", "path.1", ...

GAM 3.75.01

The commands gam show fileinfo/filepath and print filelist now show all file paths for a file or folder; previously, only one file path was shown.
Whenever a file path is shown, there is also an indication as to whether the path is "orphaned", i.e., the file path does not start at the root of Drive.
The headers for gam print filelist have been changed. Previously, there was a header "path" with a value showing one possible path to a file.
Now, there is a header "paths" with a value indicating the number of paths to the file; the paths have headers "path.0", "orphaned.0", "path.1", "orphaned.1", ...
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show fileinfo <DriveFileEntity> [filepath] [allfields|<DriveFieldName>*]
    gam <UserTypeEntity> print|show filelist [todrive] [query <QueryDriveFile>] [fullquery <QueryDriveFile>] [filepath] [allfields|<DriveFieldName>*] (orderby <DriveOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending])*
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filepath <DriveFileEntity>

GAM 3.75.00

Gam forward and print/show forward now use Gmail API. 

GAM 3.74.05

Added support for specifying type in multi-valued schemas. Custom schema fields can be single-valued or multi-valued;
Gam has always supported both but has not supported the type characteristic within a multi-valued schema field.
In gam create/update user, schema fields are now specified as:
    <SchemaName>.<FieldName> [multivalued [type work|home|other|(custom <CustomType>)]] <String>
Examples:
TestSchema.SVField <String> - value is <String>
TestSchema.MVField <String> - type is work (default), value is <String>
TestSchema.MVField type home <String> - type is home, value is <String>
TestSchema.MVField type custom <CustomType> <String> - type is custom, customType is <CustomType>, value is <String>
Compatability note: In the unlikely case that you are currently setting a multi-valued schema field with the value "type",
i.e., TestSchema.MVField type, you will have to change this to TestSchema.MVField type work type.

If you have external programs that produce multi-column files of data, but witout headers, you have to add a
header row to the file before Gam can read the file as a CSV file. Now, you can use the file as is and specify the
headers in Gam. There are several places where the headers can be specified:
    csvfile <FileName>(:<FieldName>)+ [charset <Charset>] [fields <FieldNameList>] (matchfield <FieldName> <RegularExpression>)* [delimiter <String>]
    gam csv <FileName>|- [charset <Charset>] [fields <FieldNameList>] (matchfield <FieldName> <RegularExpression>)* gam <GAMArgumentList>

GAM 3.74.04

Use Directory API to update customer language.

GAM 3.74.03

Improve handling of inappropriate email addresses in GAPI Service calls.

GAM 3.74.02

Fix error in gam print group-members.

GAM 3.74.01

Handle cachediscoveryonly.txt when discovery is read from file.

GAM 3.74.00

Added cachediscoveryonly.txt signal file.
If nocache.txt exists, no GAM API calls are cached.
If nocache.txt does not exist and cachediscoveryonly.txt does not exist, all GAM API calls are cached.
If nocache.txt does not exist and cachediscoveryonly.txt exists, only GAM discovery API calls are cached.
The last combination caches GAM discovery API calls that usually return the same value
without consuming large amounts of disc space as when all GAM API calls are cached.

GAM 3.73.04

Added userfields to gam print group-members to allow output of additional user fields.
Add recursive argument to gam print group-members to show users from sub-groups rather than the sub-group name itself.
Two new columns indicate the sub-group that a user comes from and the depth of the sub-group.
The noduplicates argument ensures that a user only appears once in the list.
    gam print group-members|groups-members [todrive] ([domain <DomainName>] [member <UserItem>])|[group <GroupItem>]
	[membernames] <MembersFieldName>* [fields <MembersFieldNameList>] [userfields <UserFieldNameList>] [recursive [noduplicates]]

GAM 3.73.03

Signatures and vacation messages were converting newlines to <br/> inappropriately, this has been corrected.

GAM 3.73.02

Selectors that use CSV files mow have the matchfield argument that allows selection of rows within the CSV file.
To select a row from a CSV file, all matchfields must be present in the row and all <RegularExpression>s must match.
When specifying a flat file or CSV file as the source of a list of items, you can specify a delimiter so that multiple values can be
obtained from a single row of a flat file or a single column of a CSV file.
The data selector csvfile <FileName>:<FieldName> has been expanded to <FileName>(:<FieldName>)+. This allows you to gather data
from several columns; the columns do not have to be contiguous.
<UserTypeEntity> ::=
		...
		(file <FileName> [charset <CharSet>] [delimiter <String>)]
		(csvfile <FileName>(:<FieldName>)+ [charset <Charset>] (matchfield <FieldName> <RegularExpression>)* [delimiter <String>])|

The matchfield aregument is also available with the gam csv command.
gam csv <FileName>|- [charset <Charset>] (matchfield <FieldName> <RegularExpression>)* gam <GAMArgumentList>

Given the file DeptGroups.csv:
Department,Group
Sales,sales-ny@bar.com
Sales,sales-nj@bar.com
Marketing,mktg-ny@bar.com
Marketing,mktg-nj@bar.com

gam csv DeptGroups.csv matchfield Department Sales gam print group-members group ~Group
gam csv DeptGroups.csv matchfield Group '.*ny.*' gam print group-members group ~Group

The data selector csvfile <FileName>:<FieldName> has been expanded to <FileName>(:<FieldName>)+. This allows you to gather data
from several columns; the columns do not have to be contiguous.
Given the file Group1Users.csv with two columns with multiple values in each column separated by a space.
UsersAB,UsersCD
user1a@bar.com user1b@bar.com,user1c@bar.com user1d@bar.com
user2a@bar.com user2b@bar.com,user2c@bar.com user2d@bar.com
...

gam update group group1@bar.com sync members csvfile Group1Users.csv:UsersAB:UsersCD delimiter ' '

GAM 3.73
Expanded the options for parameter substitution in gam csv, RE pattern substitution is now available.
An argument containing instances of ~~xxx~!~pattern~!~replacement~~ has ~~...~~ replaced by re.sub(pattern, replacement, value of field xxx from the CSV file)
An argument containing instances of ~~xxx~~ has xxx replaced by the value of field xxx from the CSV file
An argument containing exactly ~xxx is replaced by the value of field xxx from the CSV file
For example, ~~primaryEmail~!~^(.+)@(.+)$~!~\1 AT \2~~ would replace foo@bar.com (from the primaryEmail column) with foo AT bar.com

GAM 3.72
Added products <ProductIDList> argument to gam info user <User> so that licenses for desired products can be shown.
You can specify products or skus but not both.
gam info user [<UserItem>] [noaliases] [nogroups] [nolicenses|nolicences] [noschemas] [schemas <SchemaNameList>] [userview] <UserFieldName>* [fields <UserFieldNameList>] [(products|product <ProductIDList>)|(skus|sku <SKUIDList>)]

gam info group <Group> ... [noaliases] [groups]

Added argument to gam print cros to limit number of activeTimeRanges and recentUsers entries
gam print cros ... [listlimit <Number>]

Added argument to gam <UserTypeEntity> signature and gam <UserTypeEntity> vacation to allow specification of file character set so that extended characters can be read.
Credit to Steve Main for suggesting the following enhancement.
Added argument to gam <UserTypeEntity> signature and gam <UserTypeEntity> vacation to allow pattern substitution in the signature and vacation message.
gam <UserTypeEntity> signature <String>|(file <FileName> [charset <Charset>]) (replace <Tag> <String>)*
gam <UserTypeEntity> vacation <TrueValues> subject <String> (message <String>)|(file <FileName> [charset <CharSet>]) (replace <Tag> <String>)*
	[contactsonly] [domainonly] [startdate <Date>] [enddate <Date>]
Every instance of {<Tag>} in the signature/message will be replaced by <String>. Instances of the form {RT}...{Tag}...{/RT} will be eliminated
if there was no <Tag> specified that matches Tag or if a <Tag> matching Tag was specified but the matching <String> is empty.
This is especially useful with CSV files.
gam csv Users.csv gam user "~User" signature file SignatureTemplate.txt replace "#User#" "~User" replace "#Title#" "~Title"

Added argument to gam <UserTypeEntity> show signature to format the signature.
gam <UserTypeEntity> show signature [format]

Added argument to gam add/update calendar to allow specification of event notifications

Added argument to gam print group-members to allow output field selection.
gam print group-members [todrive] ([domain <DomainName>] [member <UserItem>])|[group <GroupItem>] [membernames] [fields <MembersFieldNameList>]
MembersFieldNameList is a comma separated list of field names: email | group | id | name | role | type

Added argument to gam info user to specify SKUs for which license information is desired.
gam info user [<UserItem>] ... [skus <SKUIDList>]

Added argument to gam print printjobs and gam printjob <PrinterID> fetch to allow specifying the maximum number of print jobs to retrieve.
gam printjob <PrinterID> fetch		... [limit <Number>]
gam print printjobs  ... [limit <Number>]
limit <Number> specifies the maximum number of print jobs to retrieve; defaults to 25, set limit to 0 to retrieve all print jobs.

Credit to Seth Stein for the following enhancements.
Added argument to gam <UserTypeEntity> get drivefile to allow downloading a specific revision of a drive file.
gam <UserTypeEntity> get drivefile <DriveFileEntity> [format <FileFormatList>] [targetfolder <FilePath>] [revision <Number>]

Added alternative command to add delegates and command to print delegates.
gam <UserTypeEntity> add delegate|delegates <UserEntity>
gam <UserTypeEntity> print delegates [todrive]

Improved Gmail filter processing.
gam <UserTypeEntity> [add] filter [from <EmailAddress>] [to <EmailAddress>] [subject <String>] [haswords|query <List>] [nowords|negatedquery <List>] [musthaveattachment|hasattachment] [excludechats] [size larger|smaller <ByteCount>]

gam <UserTypeEntity> show signature|sig [format]

Use Gmail API for POP/IMAP/Vacation processing.
gam <UserTypeEntity> imap|imap4 <Boolean> [noautoexpunge] [expungebehavior archive|deleteforever|trash] [maxfoldersize 0|1000|2000|5000|10000]

gam <UserTypeEntity> print gmailprofile [todrive]
gam <UserTypeEntity> show gmailprofile

Added command to print Gplus Profiles to CSV file, dropped all arguments from gam show gplusprofile.
gam <UserTypeEntity> print gplusprofile [todrive]
gam <UserTypeEntity> show gplusprofile

Added command to print user schemas to CSV file, renamed command to display formatted user schemas to gam show schemas.
gam print schemas [todrive]
gam show schemas

Added command to print user access tokens to CSV file.
gam <UserTypeEntity> print tokens|token|3lo|oauth [todrive]

Added arguments to gam info cros to allow specification of desired output fields.
gam info cros <CrosDeviceEntity> [nolists] [listlimit <Number>]
	[basic|full|allfields] <CrOSFieldName>* [fields <CrOSFieldNameList>]

Added drivedir and targetfolder <FilePath> arguments to gam printjob fetch and gam get photo to
allow specification of the destination folder for the file retrieved from Google. The default
location for these commands is the current working directory, drivedir specifies the value of the environment variable GAMDRIVEDIR and
targetfolder <FilePath> specifies a user-choosen path.
gam printjob <PrinterID>|any fetch
	[olderthan|newerthan <PrintJobAge>] [query <QueryPrintJob>]
	[status <PrintJobStatus>]
	[orderby <PrintJobOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]]
	[owner|user <EmailAddress>]
	[limit <Number>] [drivedir|(targetfolder <FilePath>)]
gam <UserTypeEntity> get photo [drivedir|(targetfolder <FilePath>)]

Added noshow argument to gam get photo to suppress displaying of photo data
gam <UserTypeEntity> get photo [drivedir|(targetfolder <FilePath>)] [noshow]

Changed gam print cros to match gam print users. Previously, gam print cros produced a full listing of CrOS devices
and gam print users produced a listing of primaryEmail addresses. Now, gam print cros produces a listing of deviceIds.
To get the previous behavior, say gam print cros full. See GamCommands.txt for a summary of CrOS and User printing.

Commands that produce CSV file output have been changed to make the leftmost column(s) be the key fields.
If you have scripts that process the CSV files as flat files, expecting the columns to be in a particular
order, they will have to be updated. If your scripts process the CSV files by column header, no changes should be required.

2016/07/31

Changed gam get drivefile to take a list of file formats rather than a single format. The first format in the list that is available will be used.
Added drivefilename argument to allow downloading file by name.
<FileFormat> ::= csv|html|txt|tsv|jpeg|jpg|png|svg|pdf|rtf|pptx|xlsx|docx|odt|ods|openoffice|ms|microsoft|micro$oft
<FileFormatList> ::= '<FileFormat>(,<FileFormat)*'
gam <UserTypeEntity> get drivefile (id <DriveFileID>)|(drivefilename <DriveFileName>)|(query <QueryDriveFile>) [format <FileFormatList>] [targetfolder <FilePath>] [revision <Number>]

2016/08/01

Added delimiter <String> argument to gam print courses to allow choice of delimiter to separate aliases.
gam print courses [todrive] [teacher] [student] [alias|aliases] [delimiter <String>]

Added notsuspended argument to gam update group add/sync to prevent adding suspended users to a group
when specifying all users, org <OrgUnitPath> or query <QueryUser> for <UserTypeEntity>.
gam update group <GroupItem> add [owner|manager|member] [notsuspended] <UserTypeEntity>
gam update group <GroupItem> sync [owner|manager|member] [notsuspended] <UserTypeEntity>

Added basic|full argument to gam print mobile to allow specification of output detail desired.
gam print mobile [todrive] [query <QueryMobile>] [basic|full] [orderby <MobileOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]]

2016/08/02

Make the file selection arguments for all drivefile and drivefileacl commands consistent.
<DriveFileEntity> ::= ([id] <DriveFileItem>)|(ids <DriveFileList>|<FileSelector>|<ArgsSelector>|<CSVkmdSelector>|<CSVDataSelector>)|(drivefilename[:| ]<DriveFileName>)|(query[:| ]<QueryDriveFile>)|root
    
The commands gam get drivefile and  gam update drivefile have been slightly restricted. Previously, these commands
allowed the <DriveFileEntity> to be specified anywhere in the list of arguments; now, <DriveFileEntity> must appear as the first argument after
the argument drivefile. This makes these commands consistent with gam delete drivefile and gam undelete drivefile.

Add arguments to gam show filetree to allow selection of starting folder and specification of output ordering.
    gam <UserTypeEntity> show filetree [<DriveFileEntity>] [orderby <DriveOrderByFieldName> [ascending|descending]]*
If <DriveFileEntity> is omitted, the filetree output starts with the root folder.

2016/08/11

Note!!! Added command to print Gmail Profiles to CSV file, dropped all arguments from gam show gmailprofile.
Use print for CSV style output, show for formatted output.
gam <UserTypeEntity> print gmailprofile [todrive]
gam <UserTypeEntity> show gmailprofile

Note!!! Added command to print Gplus Profiles to CSV file, dropped all arguments from gam show gplusprofile.
Use print for CSV style output, show for formatted output.
gam <UserTypeEntity> print gplusprofile [todrive]
gam <UserTypeEntity> show gplusprofile

GAM 2.991
  -gam print commands now support a "todrive" argument. When specified, instead of displaying the CSV output locally (or piping it to a file), GAM will upload the CSV data to a Google Docs Spreadsheet owned by the admin you've authenticated as. The spreadsheet will be opened automatically or, if you've created nobrowser.txt, a URL will be shown.
  -GAM should handle non-English input characters better. Commands like: "gam.py update user rpinaya lastname Piñaya" should work without issue on Windows.
  -Improved errors in various places (less "explosions" more meaningful instructions.
  -gam undelete user is fixed to always use the user's id rather than email address. If an email address is supplied, GAM converts it to a id before attempting to delete. If more than 1 deleted user exists with that address, GAM displays the options.

  -Fixed updating and deleting domain and default users for calendar ACLs
  -proper error handling for adding and removing group members and owners
  -Fixed error on gam info domain caused by failure to retrieve outbound gateway settings.
  -An EXPERIMENTAL 64-bit build of GAM for Windows is now available. I do not expect it will be any bit faster for most GAM commands since most delay
   is due to network I/O. However, some GAM commands like "gam print users", when run against large domains (10,000+ users), use a large amount of memory
   and resources due to result size. In these scenarios, the x64 build MIGHT prove faster. If you try the x64 build, please report how it worked back to 
   the mailing list. "It feels faster" is nice but hard numbers with details of what you did are better :-) Note that if you're using the Python source
   build and your Python is 64-bit, you're already using 64-bit GAM :-)

GAM 2.52
  -It's a dud! Major bug caused me to pull this version 10 minutes after release :-)

GAM 2.51
  -New gam calendar wipe command allows clearing all data off a user's primary calendar
  -create user and update user commands now support setting user's org.
  -gam whatis command allows looking up an email address to determine if it's a user, alias or group.

  -Fix issue that broke gam delete resource command
  -GAM now offers to remember your client secret and key when entered the first time
  -various other bug fixes

GAM 2.5
  -GAM now handles and retries errors consistently and provides nice error messages. Long running GAM processes
   like "gam all users" should be much stabler now. Death to the 1000/Unknown errors!
   This involved some major changes to the Google API calls so if you run into problems, try
   downgrading to 2.3.1 and see if they go away. Be sure to submit bug reports!
  -GAM checks for updates 
  -New parameters for gam create user and gam update user
  -New parameters for gam print group: owners, members and settings
  -GAM now works for delegated admins with user read/create/update/delete API rights
  -gam update group add owner now only adds the user as a group owner, not a member (Google Group member
   and owner status are independant of each other)
  -gam update group add member no longer revokes user's owner rights if they have them
  -gam info group now shows owners who are not a member of the group
  -gam now works around the group settings "Backend Error" by making an HTTP request to the groups website.
   This workaround may cease to work if performed on more than a few hundred groups at a time.
  -moving large numbers of users to an Organization is now more reliable and is performed 25 users at a time.
  -gam print users aliases now makes only 1 API call to retrieve all user aliases

  -gam info domain now shows the unique customer id

  -special user * (everyone in domain) can now be added to a group via GAM
  -print groups, print resources, print aliases and print orgs commands now output proper CSV
  -Dito company information now displayed on OAuth token create
  
GAM 2.3

  -GAM is now owned by Dito (www.ditoweb.com), the Google Apps Experts! See announcement and details at http://code.google.com/p/google-apps-manager
  -New user profile photo management commands can update, get and delete user profile photos
  -GAM now gracefully handles cross-domain mailbox delegations by using (or giving the delegate) an alias in the mailbox's domain.
  -"gam user XXXX show delegates" now has optional argument "csv" to print existing delegations in CSV format
  -GAM can now properly rename and delete long usernames by ensuring that the renamed user is max 64 characters in length
  -"gam print groups" now has optional arguments nousermanagedgroups and onlyusermanagedgroups allowing user managed groups to be excluded from output or print user managed groups exclusively.

  -Delete Gmail labels command
  -Fixes for *nix CSV formatting
  -Fixes to make Windows and *nix generated oauth.txt files compatible
  -"gam info user" now shows mailbox quota and user organization
  -"gam update user" can now handle change of user's domain in renames. "gam multi" commands now fully deprecated.
  -Fix reply_to and a few other group settings were never getting updated.
  -"gam info group" now makes 3 efficient API calls rather than one per member/owner of the group greatly increasing performance with large groups
  -GAM should do a better job of always printing out full email address instead of just username. If you see GAM reporting only the username and not the full email address, please report it as a bug.
  -All OAuth scopes are now selected by default.

GAM 2.1.1

  -Fix to prevent unnecessary call to Groups Provisioning API when viewing detailed group settings
  -should be show_in_group_directory not show_in_groups_directory.

GAM 2.1

  -New Reporting API Support allows you to pull 5 different daily reports: accounts, activity, disk_space, email_clients and summary.
  -Fix for Adding calendars to a user's list of calendars. Bug in 2.0 meant calendar was always added to the calendar list of the admin who authorized GAM, not the target user.
  -GAM now looks for an environment variable called OAUTHFILE. If it exists, GAM will use that file instead of oauth.txt for authentication. This allows admins of many Google Apps domains to switch quickly between domains.
  -Fixes for many "gam print users" issues. Thanks to Craig Box for the patch.

GAM 2.0

-Group Settings commands allow you to update Google Group settings
-Calendar commands allow you to grant access to calendars and modify user's list of calendars
-Update Admin Settings like the logo, outbound gateway, email migration and more
-OAuth is now the default authentication method. Support for username/password ClientLogin has been removed.
-Vacation/Away messages can now have a start and end date. They can also be limited to within the domain only.
-Further work to make all GAM commands multi-domain friendly.
-Lot's more bugfixes! look at the Wiki pages for details

GAM 1.9.1

-"gam print postini" will print all of the Postini Batch commands necessary to "mirror" Google Apps email addresses
  into a Postini standalone instance.

-"gam version" will print details about the version of GAM you are using.

GAM 1.9 - "Baby Steps"

GAM 1.9 is dedicated to David, my 13 month year old son. Whose just starting to step out into the world this week.

-whatnew.txt is new (is that an oxymoron?)

-Share or Hide users profile from autocomplete and contacts search.
  "gam user jsmith show profile"
  "gam user jsmith profile share"
  "gam group asked-to-be-hidden profile unshare"
  
  Profile modifications only work with OAuth, not ClientLogin (username/password entered into GAM). 
  Since the profile API uses a scope GAM was not previously making use of, you'll need to re-run
  "gam oauth request" to include the Profile API scope.

-Numerous actions can now be performed for all users in a given Organizational
  Unit just like they can be for a group or all users. i.e. "gam ou Students webclips off".

-Provisioning API OAuth scope has been subdivided into user, group, alias and ou scopes
  offering finer granularity.

-"gam all users" will now include all users across primary and secondary domains instead of just primary domain users.

-"gam info user" will show all email aliases for a user, not just those in the primary domain.

-"gam print users" with any extra arguments would fail, this should be fixed now.

-"gam info group" and "gam print groups" should no longer fail for groups with custom permissions.

GAM 1.8

-OAuth Support - GAM now supports OAuth Authentication. Instead of providing GAM your username and password, you grant GAM access to selected APIs from within your Google Account. This has a number of advantages:
  -With OAuth GAM doesn't need to know your password.
  -OAuth tokens don't expire, once you grant GAM OAuth access, GAM will have access until you revoke it within your Google account.
  -OAuth has the concept of scopes, limiting the areas and services that access is granted to. This allows you to only provide GAM with the privileges it needs.
  -More info about OAuth support is on it's way. But for now, you can try OAuth access by running "gam oauth request".

-The settings filter command http://code.google.com/p/google-apps-manager/wiki/ExamplesEmailSettings#Create_a_Filter now has more actions including forward, star, trash and never send to spam.

-Downloading Audit Exports now has partial resume support. GAM will not re-download files that already exist on the local drive. If a large export download fails you should delete the last file GAM was working on since it's incomplete and then restart the process, GAM will pick up with the last file.
